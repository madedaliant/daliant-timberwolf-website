                    <h2>Description</h2>

                    <p>
                        The OmniMech Timberwolf, also known as the Mad Cat in the Inner Sphere, is one of the most iconic and feared 'Mechs in the BattleTech universe. Designed by Clan Wolf, it is a heavy class 'Mech, weighing at 75 ton. Its design blends both heavy firepower and impressive speed, which made it a staple in Clan warfare.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Timberwolf features a sleek, predatory appearance with it's torso hunched forward. It's legs are reverse-jointed, allowing for increased mobility across various terrains. The arms are slightly shorter than other 'Mechs but house an array of deadly energy and ballistic weapons, while it's missile racks mounted on top of the torso, giving it the distinct "cat ears" look.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It's weapons configuration can vary greatly due to it's OmniMech design, allowing for quick swap-outs based on mission needs. However, it's most common loadout features a combination of LRMs, Large and Medium Lasers, as well as Machine Guns, offering devastating versatility in battle. It is equipped with advanced Clan-tech systems, enhancing it's combat effectiveness in both direct engagements and hit-and-run tactics.

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Timberwolf was first introduced in the 2940s by Clan Wolf as part of their OmniMech program. OmniMechs were revolutionary designs that allowed for modular weapon loadouts, enabling 'Mechs like the Timberwolf to adapt to a variety of combat roles without needing to be rebuilt. Clan engineers sought to create a mech that could deliver overwhelming firepower while maintaining the mobility necessary for fast-paced Clan warfare.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Timberwolf was a significant leap in design, blending elements of medium and heavy 'Mechs. At 75 tons, it packed the armament of a heavier machine while maintaining the speed and agility of lighter 'Mechs. The Timberwolf quickly became a favorite among Clan warriors, especially for frontline command units, as it could lead the charge with overwhelming firepower while still being mobile enough to dictate the flow of battle.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Timberwolf became a terrifying sight for Inner Sphere forces when the Clans launched their invasion in 3050. For many soldiers and commanders in the Inner Sphere, the Timberwolf was the first Clan OmniMech they encountered, and it's devastating performance on the battlefield led to widespread fear and confusion. Inner Sphere forces, unable to identify the Timberwolf, gave it the codename Mad Cat due to it's resemblance to both the Catapult (because of the missile pods) and Marauder (due to its general shape).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During the Clan invasion, the Timberwolf served as a frontline assault unit, often leading Star formations into battle. It's ability to quickly adapt to different combat environments and it's devastating mix of long-range and medium-range weapons made it the perfect 'Mech for the Clans’ blitzkrieg-style tactics. It was a nightmare for Inner Sphere forces, whose own 'Mechs struggled to match its speed and firepower, and it was instrumental in securing many Clan victories during the initial invasion waves.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After the initial Clan invasion, the Timberwolf remained a staple of Clan forces, particularly Clan Wolf and Clan Jade Falcon, but it's fame spread throughout all Clans. Over the years, several variants of the Timberwolf were produced, adapting to different strategic needs. The Inner Sphere, though initially outmatched, eventually began to produce knockoffs or captured versions of the Timberwolf, though they could never fully replicate the Clan’s superior tech.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Timberwolf’s place in history was solidified through it's sheer battlefield presence. Even after the fall of the Clans and the eventual fragmentation of their military might, the Timberwolf continued to be used by Clan loyalists and Inner Sphere powers who could salvage or replicate the design. It's legendary status persisted long after the initial invasion, influencing the development of future 'Mechs and remaining a symbol of the pinnacle of Clan warfare technology.

                    <h2>Armaments</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Timberwolf's armaments are a deadly combination of long-range and medium-range firepower, typically featuring two LRM-20 launchers mounted on the shoulders for long-distance bombardment and two ER Large Lasers for precision strikes. In addition, it often carries two ER Medium Lasers, a Medium Pulse Laser, and two Machine Guns for close-quarters engagements, giving it the versatility to dominate at any range. The Timberwolf’s modular OmniMech design allows these weapons to be easily swapped out for mission-specific loadouts, ensuring it can adapt to various battlefield roles.

                            Hi there! My name is Daliant, also known online as MuppetNoob. I created this website while alongside learning how to code HTML here at Dicoding. Since the final assignment is to create a website, I'll use this website I worked on as my submission for this assignment. After all, I've worked hard on it and I'm very proud of the result!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I made this website to mimic the look of a real, official BattleTech website. Why, you might ask? Well, because I love BattleTech! Creating a website about my favorite giant, stompy robot franchise as my final assignment brings me joy!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Alright, that's it for my website. Thank you for reading! :)
